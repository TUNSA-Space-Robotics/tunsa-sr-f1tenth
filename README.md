# TUNSA Space Robotics F1TENTH Workspace

This repository contains our ROS workspace for the F1TENTH Autonomous Vehicle Course labs provided by the University of Pennsylvania. We worked through the first 5 labs of this course.

Lab 2 - Automatic Emergency Braking
======================================
.. tip:: Before starting this lab, review :ref:`Lecture 2 <doc_lecture02>` to ensure you are familiar with the material.

| **Goals:**
| The goal of this lab is to develop a safety node for the race cars that will stop the car from collision when travelling at higher velocities. We will implement Time to Collision using the LaserScan message in the simulator. 

| **Learning Outcomes:**
| The following fundamentals should be understood by the students upon completion of this lab:

	* Using the LaserScan message in ROS
	* Time to Collision (TTC)
	* Safety critical systems

**Required Skills:** Basics of ROS from Lab 1, Python or C++ (or at least some programming experience)

**Allotted Time:** 1 week

| **Repository:** `Github Repository <https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_labs/tree/master/lab2>`_ 
|	The repository contains the latex source files as well as any skeleton code. Compile the latex source files to view the most up to date handout.
